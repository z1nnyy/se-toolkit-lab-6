## 1. Numbered sections

All top-level sections must be numbered starting from 1.
Nested subsections use the format `S.N.` where S is the parent section number (e.g., `2.1.`, `2.2.`).

---

## 2. Table of contents

Each convention file must include a table of contents immediately after the title.
Use an HTML heading (`<h2>Table of contents</h2>`) instead of a Markdown `##` heading so the TOC entry does not appear inside its own list.
Follow the HTML heading with a blank line, then the TOC list.
The TOC list must be in Markdown format (bullet list with `- [Link](#anchor)` syntax).

---

## 3. DRY

Don't duplicate content across convention files. If a rule already exists in one file, reference it from others using a hyperlink instead of repeating it.

---

## 4. Hyperlinks when mentioning sections

When mentioning a section by name, always link to it. For sections in another file, include the file path in the link.

Good: `See [Section name](#section-name).`

Good (cross-file): `See [Section name](other-file.md#section-name).`

Bad: `See the Section name section.`

---

## 5. No Markdown tables

Never use Markdown tables in convention files. Use bullet lists instead — they are easier to read, write, and maintain.

---

## 6. Section link text

Don't include the section number in the link text when linking inline. Use only the section name.

In a table of contents, you may include the section number in the link text.

Good (inline): `[Section name](#323-section-name)`

Good (TOC): `[3.2.3. Section name](#323-section-name)`

Bad (inline): `[3.2.3. Section name](#323-section-name)`
